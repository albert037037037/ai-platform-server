# AI Platform on Kubernetes for Automated ML Pipeline Development and Operations

## Motivation
Since Machine Learning code is just a small part of the ML production system, we need a system to manage the overall procedure. Besides, with ML pipeline, Independent steps allow multiple data scientists to work on the same pipeline at the same time without over-taxing compute resources. Moreover, in the Machine Learning process, there are many resources which are reusable. Therefore, we develop a ML platform that supports automated ML pipeline development and resource sharing with multi-tenancy.

## Features and advantages
1. MLOps for end-to-end ML pipeline
2. Monitoring (resource usage, job...)
3. Resource sharing(CPU, memory, GPU), management 4, Data and model sharing with ACL
5. Support multi-tenants
6. Container management with Kubernetes
7. 
### This github project is backend part.
